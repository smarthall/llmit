## Setting up

This tool uses Poetry to manage the python environment and dependencies. To get setup run:

```
poetry install
poetry shell
```

You will need your environment setup correctly. This can be done by creating
an `.env` file in your working directory. See `.env.example` for example
contents. Alternately you can set these values as environment variables.
